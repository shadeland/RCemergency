backbone-codeigniter-rest-boilerplate
==============================

Was making this for my own purposes and figured I'd put it here in case it could help anoyone else.

<strong>Front-end</strong>: Backbone.js w/ jQuery, Bootstrap, Mustache, LoDash

* The front-end / Backbone portion is completely derived / distilled from <a href="https://github.com/thomasdavis/backboneboilerplate">Thomas Davis' Backbone Boilerplate</a>. I just added in Mustache and enhanced Boostrap (responsive + bootstrap.js), changed some other things around as well as emptied out Thomas' stuff so it's a clean project that you can download and start right away.

<strong>Back-end</strong>: CodeIgniter w/ Phil Sturgeon's Rest Library
