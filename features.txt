# Ordering And Suggestion
    we gonna list all vehicle with selected Statement :
        if ( has Order ):
            show Order In List With Cancel button !/it not possible for a vehicle to have multiple Orders
        else:
            order will insert in queue .
        When Device Connected :
         if(input2 ==1 || output1==1 &&  has order )
            We Will Wait ;
         if ( input2 == 0 && output1 ==0  has order)
            we will set output1 to 1 ;
         if ( input2 == 1 && output1 == 1 )
            we will set output1 to 0 ;
    ToDO : Canceling queued order !
BUG ::
    #Position Retreive Has Problem ,sort by recieve-date
    #Order ,And Status : when we send order to device What will happen to its status
    #If device Send Stored Previous data do we Know?




 :: TODOS::
 should find better implement for objects to prevent to many db requests !
